# Quiz

- Task to build a quiz using three different elements, needed to include a dropdown and radio button selection.
- Started with the overall layout and looking into the different form elements I could use. With inspiration of it being mental health month it seemed suitable to include questions for a checkin. Upon having the main code in place I was able to remove duplicate code using map to render the options for some questions.
- If I had more time I would include more questions and change the following question pending the answer of the previous one.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
